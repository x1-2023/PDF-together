  <!-- Material Symbols (We might need to download this too if blocked, but usually Google Fonts CSS is the issue. 
       If symbols are blocked, we need to self-host them. 
       For now, let's keep the link but if it fails we need to download. 
       Actually, the log showed fonts.googleapis.com blocked. 
       So we should probably self-host icons too or use a package. 
       Let's use the google fonts link for now but be ready to switch if it fails. 
       Wait, the user log showed: "Loading the stylesheet ... fonts.googleapis.com ... blocked".
       So we MUST remove this link. 
       I will use 'material-symbols' package or just download the font.
       For simplicity, I'll assume the user might accept broken icons for a moment or I should install 'material-symbols'.
       Let's install 'material-symbols' package in the next step.
